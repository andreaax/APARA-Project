           “I’m a junior at School for Advanced Studies (SAS) - North Campus. I’m currently a co-researcher and video editor for the APARA Project. This role entails that I gather research relating to financial literacy, build a framework of relevant questions pertaining to college costs, and edit the video for submission. <br><br>

I’m grateful that the APARA Project has allowed me to not only get a headstart on college research for my senior year but also collaborate with my peers to create a tool (college cost calculator) that I hope students in Florida will use for years to come.”<br>

           “Hello, I’m a senior at School for Advanced Studies North and a front-end programmer for the project. Along with Rachel, I worked on the design of the website. I mainly troubleshot the coding and integrated the written segments.<br><br>

Project APARA was a new experience for me. As a mechanical engineering major with a focus on robotics, I’ve never fully designed a website. I’ve worked on other projects like programming an Arduino-based robot, working on a bionic hand (for SECME), and writing various programs using C and C++. Besides robotics, I enjoy studying philosophy— which I intend to minor in.<br><br>

I enjoyed working with the girls on Project APARA. I got to apply my knowledge of HTML and CSS, and I learned a lot more. I want to work on another project that ties web design and robotics in the future. ”<br>

           “Hello, I am a junior at School For Advanced Studies-North. In the APARA project, I worked with Alianis to help gather research and financial literacy-related information including articles, data about college tuition fees, and financial aid.<br><br>
            
As a Computer Engineering major, this was a great way for me to learn from my peers and get more experience. Being a junior, this project has also helped me know more about the college process and make better decisions as to what college I can afford and what scholarships are available.<br><br>
            
Besides working with computers, I enjoy writing, math, and playing sports.”<br>

           “I’m a senior at School for Advanced Studies North and a front-end programmer for the APARA Project. I worked on the design and layout of the website using HTML and CSS. I initiated the project last year because I felt there wasn’t enough being done to educate low-income students about college.<br><br>

I discovered computer science the summer before my junior year. I still consider myself a beginner since there’s so much I still don’t know, but that also makes me excited to continue learning! In my free time, I also love drawing, writing, and watching documentaries.”<br>

Aside from working on this project, I like to consider myself artistic. I really enjoy web design, digital art, calligraphy, and photography!<br><br>

As a FGLI student myself, I know how words such as “loans” and “work-study” can seem foreign at first; therefore, I hope that this project can guide others. The APARA Project will be an excellent resource for my fellow SAS North classmates and other low-income students.”<br>
