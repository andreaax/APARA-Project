<br></br>
Before discussing decision deadlines, we need to establish the two common admission seasons. Colleges in the U.S. accept students fall or spring semester. Most students apply during the fall semester. The fall semester (September, October, November) is right after highschool, so when seniors graduate around June or July the transition to college in fall is the most fitting. Other students apply for spring season admission (March, April, May). Some students may want some time off before college to maybe travel, and other students have personal reasons for applying during that time.

<br></br>
      There are 5 types of decision deadlines: early decision (ED), early action (EA),  restricted early action (restricted EA), regular decision (RD), and rolling admissions. The “early” deadlines are before all the others. The deadline for both ED and EA is sometime around November, and the decision release is usually around December. You have a greater chance of getting accepted when you apply by these deadlines because the university can assume that they’re one of your top choices.
<br></br>
Applying early decision is binding, meaning if you get accepted to the school, you legally have to attend. You can only apply to one school ED. Early decision are for students who are 100% sure that if accepted they’ll commit to the school, and that they’ll be able to cover the cost of the college. 
<br></br>
Applying early action is not binding. You can apply to more than one school early action. It is the safer option to ED.
<br></br>
Restricted early action is not binding, but you can only apply to one school early action. This option is a mix of ED and EA. some schools only offer restricted EA and not EA. If the university is your top choice, but you’re aren’t 100% sure you can commit financially, then restricted EA is the best option.
<br></br>
Regular decision deadlines are around January and February, and the decision release is usually by April. Regular Decision is not binding and you can apply to as many schools as you want.
<br></br>
Rolling admission accept applications and send acceptances until their spots are filled up. They don’t have a set deadline, and you can get your admission decision in weeks or months. Rolling admission is not binding and you can apply to as many schools you want.

     Many, if not most, universities require applicants to submit recommendations. Universities use recommendation letters to attest your qualities. Besides your personal statement and supplemental essays, this is one document that highlights you as a person. That is why you should get your recommendation from a teacher that knows you well enough and can speak good things about you. 
<br></br>
Who should you ask for a recommendation? In some cases, you need a particular teacher’s or person’s recommendation to make your application stronger. For example, if you’re applying as an engineering major, it’s best to get a recommendation from your math teacher. In other cases, you’re conduct or personal connection with the teacher or person is strong enough for them to write you a recommendation. You should request a recommendation letter at least a month before your decision deadline. Your recommender is busy and needs time to write you a good recommendation.
<br></br>
We have a solution for when your recommender doesn’t know you well enough. We recommend that you give your recommender a form that includes your extracurriculars (e.g., leadership, clubs, community service), honors, background, passions or hobbies, goals (educational and personal). That form will make it easier for your recommender to write you an excellent letter of recommendation. You can also give this form to a recommender that knows you well enough as a supplement.

                      <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <li>Self report</li>

      <li>Midyear</li>
      <li>Discrepancies</li>
                        
                      </ul>
<br></br>

                      Colleges assert your readiness based on your classes and grades. They get this information from your transcript. The first way of reporting grades is called self-report. Some colleges ask applicants to manually enter their highschool classes and grades. The system of reporting is different for every college, so be sure to check how they want you to enter your classes and grades. 
<br></br>
                      
                      Universities also ask for official transcripts. These are official documents from your school. Usually your counselor sends them, so make sure to notify your counselor of any deadlines. 
                      <br></br>
Colleges also ask for a midyear report. It shows them the grades you have for the first part of the school year. This means that you have to maintain good grades even after you apply or get accepted; if your grades get drastically bad, colleges can reject you after you’re accepted. 
                      <br></br>
Do not lie when you self report your grades, and pay close attention so that you don’t make a mistake. If the college finds discrepancies between your self reported transcript and your official one, they can reject you even after you’re accepted.

    College applications have many points of access. Most colleges are on the Common App and Coalition App. You can apply to other colleges through their school site. Besure to check the application portal for each school you want to apply to.

                      Some things to do before you submit your application:
                      <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <li>You can connect with other students who want to apply to the same universities as you on apps like ZeeMee. 
</li>
       <li>You can keep track of your college applications and To Do’s on sites like Scoir.</li> 
      <li>Colleges care about demonstrated interest. You want to show that you’re really interested in the school and that you would attend. To demonstrate interest you can: take an official tour of the school, join information sessions hosted by the school online, attend a summer program at the school, etc.</li>
      <li>Set meetings with your counselor. Your counselor is meant to help you throughout the process. Keep them updated on the deadlines for them to submit recommendation letters or transcripts. When you need anything, like a fee waiver or help building your college list, contact your counselor.</li>
       <li>Create a testing plan for the SAT or ACT. Buy or download subjects books, and take official practice tests.</li>

                      </ul>
<br></br>

    
Some things to do while you’re waiting for your admission decision:

                      <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <li>You should sign up for college interviews. This is another way of demonstrating interest. Your interviewer will write a note about your character that will be added to your application.

</li>
       <li>Apply to as many scholarships as you can!
</li> 
      

                      </ul>

                      <br></br>
 Some things to do after you get your admission decision:


   <ul style="padding-left: 30px;">
      <li>If you get rejected, I’m sorry for the bad news. You can now focus on other schools. If you’re adamant about the school, you can apply as a transfer student to the school later on.

</li>
       <li>If you get deferred or waitlisted, you have some options (like writing a letter of continued interest). Do some research on your particular school and what you can do.
</li> 

     <li>After getting your financial aid packages, you will compare them. If needed, you can make appeals for more aid to the schools that accepted you. You can ask a university if they can match the better offer you received from another university. You can also make appeals if you or your family have a change in finances.
</li> 

     <li>Continue to apply to scholarships!
</li> 
      

                      </ul>
